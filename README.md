# Automate-detection-and-recognition-of-grammatical-errors
# Overview:
This project is designed to automate the detection and correction of grammatical errors in sentences using advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms. The primary objective is to utilize the powerful T5-base model, fine-tuned on the JFLEG dataset, for grammatical error correction.

# Installation:
To run the project, ensure you have Python 3.x installed along with the following libraries:

- pandas
- transformers
- torch
- gradio

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas transformers torch gradio
```

# Usage:
1. **Fine-tuning the T5-Base Model:**
   - Use the provided script to fine-tune the T5-base model on the JFLEG dataset. This step involves loading the dataset, preprocessing it, defining the model architecture, training the model, and saving the fine-tuned model.

   Example usage:
   ```python
   python fine_tune_t5_base.py
   ```

2. **Interactive Grammatical Error Correction Interface:**
   - Utilize Gradio to create an interactive interface for grammatical error correction using the fine-tuned T5-base model. The interface should allow users to input sentences and receive corrected sentences as output.

   Example usage:
   ```python
   python create_gradio_interface.py
   ```

3. **Batch Correction of Sentences:**
   - Implement a function to batch process sentences for grammatical error correction using the fine-tuned T5-base model. This function should take a CSV file containing sentences as input and output a CSV file with corrected sentences.

   Example usage:
   ```python
   python batch_correction.py input_sentences.csv output_sentences.csv
   ```

# Data Format:
The input data for grammatical error correction should be provided in CSV format with a column named 'input' containing sentences to be corrected.

# Example Dataset:
An example dataset 'input_sentences.csv' is provided in the project directory. It contains sentences that require grammatical error correction.

# Output Files:
1. **output_sentences.csv:**
   - This file contains the corrected sentences generated by the fine-tuned T5-base model.

# Conceptual Approach:
The project involves fine-tuning the T5-base model on the JFLEG dataset, which comprises sentences with grammatical errors and their corrected versions. The fine-tuned model is then used to create an interactive interface using Gradio for real-time grammatical error correction. Additionally, a batch correction function is implemented to process large sets of sentences efficiently.
